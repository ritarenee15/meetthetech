["Meet the Tech: Introduction to Ruby Rita Hill ","Agenda ∙ About Ruby ∙ Diﬀerences between Ruby and other programming languages ∙ Basics ∙ Other things you’ll need to learn ∙ irb and Ruby on Rails ∙ What do we use now that’s powered by Ruby? ","About Ruby Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language Created Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto -First version was released in 1995 -Current version 2.4.0 -File extension - .rb Has said that he is trying to Ruby “natural” and while it may look “simple” it’s meant to be complex like the human body. Created from blended parts of Smalltalk, Ada, Perl, Eiﬀel, and Lisp with the idea to be more object oriented than Python Because Ruby is open source, it is absolutely free to use, distribute, copy, and modify ","What does object oriented programming mean? With Ruby, everything is an object that can be given it’s own properties and actions This properties are called instance variables and their actions are called methods “Objects are nouns, methods are verbs” 4.times { print “I love learning about Ruby!” } ","Cont. Ruby is flexible as it allows you to freely alter the methods allowing the user to remove or add to parts or completely redefine them. There are also multiple ways to perform the same action By adding a method: class Numeric def plus(x) self.+(x) end end y = 5.plus 6 Using an operator: 2+5 =&gt; 7 ","What are some diﬀerences between Ruby and other languages? Ruby does not have functions. With other programming languages, the variable would go within the function. With Ruby, the variable would be placed at the beginning of the code. Parenthesis are not used to call the method. ","Examples JS let x = 1; let y = 2, z = 3; PHP $x = 1; list($y, $z) = [2, 3]; Ruby x = 1 y, z = 2, 3 Python x = 1 y, z = 2, 3 ","Examples JS Math.floor(22 / 7) PHP (int)(22 / 7) Ruby 22 / 7 Python 22 // 7 ","Examples JS if (n === 0) { console.log('no hits'); } else if (n === 1) { console.log('1 hit'); } else { console.log(n + ' hits'); } PHP if ( 0 == $n ) { echo no hitsn; } elseif ( 1 == $n ) { echo one hitn; } else { echo $n hitsn; } Ruby if n == 0 puts no hits elsif 1 == n puts one hit else puts #{n} hits end Python if 0 == n: print('no hits') elif 1 == n: print('one hit') else: print(str(n) + ' hits') ","Examples JS for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) { console.log(i); } PHP for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 10; $i++) { echo $in; } Ruby Ruby does not have for loops! Python for i in range(1, 11): print(i) ","So what can I do with Ruby? A lot! Let’s talk about some basics. String – a collection of characters in a specific sequence Can be made with since or double quotes “The cow jumped over the moon” ‘Hi Mom!’ If you want to put single quotes within your string, you can either: “I tapped my sister and said ‘You’re it! ‘” ‘I tapped my sister and said ’You’re it!’’ ","String interpolation String interpolation – merges codes with Ruby strings. ","Finding the length We can find the length of a string: ","Reversing a string Reversing a string: ","Cases and strings Capitalize and lowercase: ","We can also do some math! We can use Ruby as a calculator as well: ","Using variables to do math Again, we can use a variable: ","Comparing integers We can compare numbers: ","Adding Strings We can even add strings together (and split them up!) ","Converting strings and integers We can go convert strings to integers and vice versa: ","Arrays Arrays store information in an ordered list. Items in the array are listed from 0 to x (meaning you start counting from 0 instead of 1 Using [x] will pull item from the array ","Hashes Hashes store items associated by keys. Values in the hash are stored with curly braces {} and separated by commas ","Loops Loops are used when we want Ruby to repeat the same action over and over...by only writing the instructions once! Be careful of the parameters you use because the system can break with an infinite loop. print “The dog is in the house.” print “The dog is in the house.” print “The dog is in the house.” 3.times do print “The dog is in the house.” End 3.times { print The dog is in the house. } ","Other loops While loops: run until loop evaluates to false while x &gt;= 0 puts x x = x - 1 end puts Done! Until loops: opposite of while loops until x &lt; 0 puts x x -= 1 end puts Done! Conditionals within loops: additional control flow while x &lt;= 10 if x.odd? puts x end x += 1 end Do while loops: executed one time prior to the conditional to see if code should be executed. loop do puts Do you want to do that again? answer = gets.chomp if answer != 'Y' ","Methods Methods allow you to run the same code throughout the program by writing it once. Use def to define the method def introduction puts Hi, I'm #{first_name}! end end ","Examples of Methods def add(a, b) a + b end def subtract(a, b) a - b end def greeting(name) Hello,  + name + . How are you doing? end puts greeting(Bob) ","Why are methods important? Everything we have discussed so far can be used within your method. Remember, everything is an object in Ruby and your methods bring everything into action. Remember, if objects are nouns, methods are verbs. ","So I want to try Ruby? What do I do next? We need to download a few things! 1. Make sure you have a code editor (Atom, Brackets, Vim, etc.) 2. Download Ruby on your computer - https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/ Follow instructions based on your computers operating system Aﬅer this, you can test your ruby code in Interactive Ruby (irb) through your command prompt 3.Download Ruby on Rails http://railsinstaller.org/en ","About irb Interactive Ruby is an REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that allows you to test your Ruby code. It’s run through your system’s command line and executes commands in real time. ","About Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails is an open source, MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework used to build websites and applications. Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. Because it runs on a web server, Rails is considered a server-side, or “back end,” web application development platform (the web browser is the “front end”). See a variety of extensions, including .erb ","What does this look like? ","What are Gems? As most programming languages, Ruby leverages a wide set of third-party libraries. Most of them are released in the form of a gem . To put in simply – Gems are available to help you build your app! Sources include Github, RubyGems, The Ruby Toolbox ",""]
